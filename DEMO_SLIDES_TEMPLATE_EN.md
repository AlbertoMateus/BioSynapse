## 📋 **NASA SUBMISSION FORM ANSWERS**

### **Project Name:**
Space Biology AI Gap Analyzer

### **High-Level Project Summary:**
We developed a web application that identifies and analyzes AI utilization gaps across NASA's 607 space biology publications. Our analysis revealed that 97.4% of research doesn't use AI, representing a massive opportunity to accelerate scientific discoveries critical for Mars missions.

### **Link to Project Demo:**
[Upload slides PDF or video to Google Drive/GitHub and provide public link]

### **Link to Final Project:**
[GitHub repository public link or hosted webpage]

### **Detailed Project Description:**
Our Space Biology AI Gap Analyzer addresses a critical problem: of NASA's 607 space biology publications, only 2.6% utilize AI/ML techniques. We created an interactive dashboard that:
- Automatically analyzes all publications using text processing
- Categorizes research into 7 biological areas
- Identifies specific AI gaps and opportunities
- Recommends prioritized techniques for each area
- Provides actionable insights for scientists and mission planners

The application uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Chart.js for visualization, and Python for data analysis. It processes real NASA publication data and generates evidence-based recommendations to accelerate space biology research.

### **NASA Data:**
We used the NASA Space Biology Publications repository (SB_publication_PMC.csv) containing 607 peer-reviewed publications from the PMC database. This data directly addresses the challenge requirements to analyze NASA's bioscience publications and build a knowledge engine for space biology research.

### **Space Agency Partner & Other Data:**
- NASA Space Biology Publications (PMC Repository)
- Chart.js (open source visualization library)
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (open source web technologies)
- Python, Pandas (open source data analysis tools)

### **Use of Artificial Intelligence:**
Yes, we utilized AI in our project development:
- **Text Analysis:** Natural language processing for keyword detection and categorization
- **Pattern Recognition:** Machine learning algorithms to classify publications by research area
- **Classification:** AI techniques to identify which publications currently use AI/ML
- **Visualization:** Algorithmic optimization for chart generation and data presentation

All AI-generated content is clearly documented in our code comments and README files.
